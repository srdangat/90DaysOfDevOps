# Linux System Fundamentals

Welcome to the Linux System Fundamentals guide. This document covers the core architecture, boot process, detailed file system hierarchy, and essential commands for daily operations.

## 1. Linux Architecture
The Linux operating system is built in layers, facilitating communication between the user and the physical hardware.



### The Layers
1.  **Hardware:** The physical computer components (CPU, RAM, Disk).
2.  **Kernel:** The core of Linux. It is the program that the machine actually understands and acts as the bridge to the hardware.
3.  **Shell:** An interactive program that takes commands from the user and sends them to the kernel.
4.  **Applications / User:** The software programs (like web browsers) and the human users interacting with the system.

> **Key Concept:** High-level code (like C Programs) is converted into binary (`1010`) so the machine can execute it.

## 2. The Boot Process
The sequence of events that occurs when a Linux system is powered on.



1.  **Power On:** The system receives power.
2.  **BIOS:** The motherboard initializes and performs a hardware check.
3.  **GNU GRUB:** The bootloader that loads the Linux Kernel into memory.
4.  **OS Loading:** The operating system begins to load (e.g., "Ubuntu Loading...").
5.  **Init Process / Systemd:** The very first process started by the kernel (Process ID 1), which then starts all other services.

## 3. File System Hierarchy
Linux uses a tree-like directory structure starting from the root (`/`). All other directories and files branch off from this single point.



| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/`** | **The Root.** The starting point of the filesystem hierarchy. |
| `/home` | Home directory for standard users (e.g., `/home/john`). Stores personal documents. |
| `/root` | The home directory specifically for the **root** (admin) user. |
| `/boot` | Contains static bootloader and kernel executables. |
| `/etc` | Contains system-wide **configuration** files and shell scripts. |
| `/bin` | **User Binaries.** Essential commands used by all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `ping`). |
| `/sbin` | **System Binaries.** Utilities used by the root user for administration (e.g., `shutdown`). |
| `/usr` | **User Programs.** The majority of user utilities and applications. |
| `/var` | **Variable Files.** Files that change size over time, such as system **logs** (`/var/log`). |
| `/dev` | **Device Files.** Entry points for hardware (e.g., `/dev/sda` for hard drives). |
| `/opt` | **Optional.** Used for installing add-on application software packages. |
| `/tmp` | **Temporary.** Stores temporary files; usually deleted upon reboot. |
| `/lib` | **Libraries.** Shared library files needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`. |
| `/media` | **Removable Media.** Mount point for USB drives, CD-ROMs, etc. |
| `/proc` | **Process Info.** A virtual filesystem providing info about running processes and kernel. |

## 4. Essential Commands & Tasks
Common commands for managing files, network, and system resources.

### Navigation & File Management
* **Change Directory:** `cd <path>`
* **Create a Folder:** `mkdir <folder_name>`
* **Create an Empty File:** `touch <file_name>`
* **Copy a File:** `cp <source> <destination>`
* **Move or Rename:** `mv <old_name> <new_name>`
    * *Usage:* `mv file.txt /home/user/docs` (Move)
    * *Usage:* `mv file.txt newname.txt` (Rename)
* **Remove (Delete):** `rm <file_name>`
    * *Warning:* To delete a folder, use `rm -r <folder_name>`.

### Network Operations
* **Find IP Address:** `ip addr`
* **Check Connectivity:** `ping <website>`
    * *Example:* `ping google.com`

### System Monitoring
* **Check Storage Usage:** `df -h`
    * *(-h displays sizes in human-readable GB/MB)*
* **Check RAM Usage:** `free -h`
