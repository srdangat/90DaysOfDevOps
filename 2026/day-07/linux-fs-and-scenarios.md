## Part 1: Linux File System Hierarchy


## / (Root Directory)
**Contains:** The top-level directory of Linux; all other directories branch from here.

**Observed (`ls -l /`):**
- `bin -> usr/bin`
- `etc/`
- `home/`
- `var/`

**I would use this when** I want to understand the overall system layout or navigate to core directories.

---

## /home
**Contains:** Home directories for normal users where personal files, scripts, and configs are stored.

**Observed (`ls -l /home`):**
- `sanket/`
- `ubuntu/`

**I would use this when** working with user files, projects, and automation scripts.

---

## /root
**Contains:** Home directory of the root (administrator) user that contains system-level configuration files and the installed Amazon SSM Agent, including its active version.

**Observed (`ls -l /root/snap/amazon-ssm-agent/`):**
- `11797/ (installed version)`
- `current -> 11797 (active version link)`

**I would use this when** managing system services and AWS agents as root.

---

## /etc
**Contains:** System-wide configuration files for users, services, networking, and boot settings.

**Observed (`ls /etc`):**
- `ssh/`
- `passwd`
- `sudoers.d/`
- `netplan/`

**I would use this when** configuring users, security, networking, or system services.

![etc directory](https://github.com/srdangat/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2026/day-07/screenshot/etc.png)

---

## /var/log
**Contains:** Log files generated by the system, services, and AWS components.

**Observed (`ls -l /var/log`):**
- `syslog`
- `auth.log`
- `cloud-init.log`
- `kern.log`

**I would use this when** troubleshooting system issues, boot problems, or service failures.

![var log](https://github.com/srdangat/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2026/day-07/screenshot/var_log.png)

---

## /tmp
**Contains:** Temporary files created by system services and applications; often cleared on reboot.

**Observed (`ls -l /tmp`):**
- `systemd-private-*`
- `snap-private-tmp/`

**I would use this when** storing temporary files during testing or script execution.

---

## /bin
**Contains:** Essential binaries required for system operation and recovery mode.

**Observed (`ls /bin`):**
- `ls`
- `cp`
- `mv`
- `bash`

**I would use this when** running core Linux commands needed for daily operations.

---

## /usr/bin
**Contains:** User-level command binaries and installed applications.

**Observed (`ls /usr/bin`):**
- `python3`
- `vim`
- `ssh`
- `systemctl`

**I would use this when** running development tools, admin commands, and installed software.

![usr bin](https://github.com/srdangat/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2026/day-07/screenshot/usr_bin.png)

---

## /opt
**Contains:** Optional or third-party software installed manually by administrators.

**Observed (`ls -l /opt`):**
- `apache-maven-3.9.12-bin.tar.gz`

**I would use this when** installing external tools like Maven, Java apps, or custom software.

# Linux Filesystem Hierarchy (FHS)

Quick revision guide for Linux filesystem hierarchy, with **examples**, **key points**, and **memory tips** .

---

## Root Directory `/`
- **Description:** Top-level directory; all files start here.
- **Exam Tip:** Always start your path from `/`.
- **Example:** `/etc/passwd`

---

## Essential Commands

| Directory | Purpose | Example | Tip |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/bin`   | Basic user commands | `/bin/ls`, `/bin/cp` | Commands needed to boot & run system |
| `/sbin`  | Admin/system commands | `/sbin/reboot`, `/sbin/fsck` | Only root/system admin uses these |

---

## Configuration Files

| Directory | Purpose | Example | Tip |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/etc`   | System-wide configuration | `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` | Think: "E" for **Edit config** |
| `/root`  | Root user home | `/root/.bashrc` | Root’s personal files |

---

## User Data & Applications

| Directory | Purpose | Example | Tip |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/home`  | User personal files | `/home/alex/document.txt` | Each user has their own folder |
| `/usr`   | User applications | `/usr/bin/python3` | Non-essential system programs |
| `/lib`   | Essential libraries | `/lib/libc.so.6` | Needed by binaries in `/bin` & `/sbin` |

---

## Logs, Temporary & Variable Data

| Directory | Purpose | Example | Tip |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/var`   | Variable data/logs | `/var/log/syslog` | Think: "Var = Variable" |
| `/tmp`   | Temporary files | `/tmp/test.tmp` | Files cleared on reboot |

---

## Boot & Devices

| Directory | Purpose | Example | Tip |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/boot`  | Bootloader/kernel | `/boot/vmlinuz` | Kernel files live here |
| `/dev`   | Device files | `/dev/sda` | Devices are files |
| `/proc`  | Process info (virtual) | `/proc/cpuinfo` | Think: "Proc = Process" |
| `/sys`   | Kernel & hardware info | `/sys/class/net` | System info interface |

---

## Mount Points

| Directory | Purpose | Example | Tip |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/mnt`   | Temporary mounts | `/mnt/backup` | Manual mounts go here |
| `/media` | Removable media | `/media/usb` | USB/CD drives appear here |

---

## Quick Memory Tricks 

- Short phrase:  
  **“Configs in `/etc`, Logs in `/var`, Users in `/home`, Commands in `/bin`”**

---

## Tips

1. **Root `/` is the starting point** – paths always start here.
2. **Remember `/bin` vs `/sbin`** – essential vs admin commands.
3. **Configuration lives in `/etc`**, user files in `/home`.
4. **Logs in `/var/log`**, temporary files in `/tmp`.
5. **Kernel & boot in `/boot`, devices in `/dev`**.
6. **Virtual dirs `/proc` & `/sys`** – they do not occupy disk space.

---


## Hands-on task:

```bash
# Find the largest log file in /var/log
du -sh /var/log/* 2>/dev/null | sort -h | tail -5

# Look at a config file in /etc
cat /etc/hostname

# Check your home directory
ls -la ~
```
