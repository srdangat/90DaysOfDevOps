# Day 27 – GitHub Profile Makeover

### Task 1: Audit Your Current GitHub Profile
Before making changes, assess where you stand:
1. Visit your own GitHub profile as if you were a stranger — what impression does it give?
2. Answer in your notes:
   - Is your profile picture professional?
        - Yes
   - Is your bio filled in? Does it say what you do?
        - No
   - Are your pinned repos relevant, or are they random forks?
        - They are mostly random forks and don’t fully showcase my own work.
   - Do your repos have descriptions, or are they blank?
        - Partially,some repos have descriptions,but many are blank or unclear.
   - Would a recruiter understand what you've been working on?
        - No, it’s hard for them to quickly see my skills, projects

3. Things improved

    **Added a Personal Introduction**
    I added a heading and short summary (e.g., Hi, I’m Sanket — Cloud & DevOps Engineer) so visitors instantly know who I am and what I do.

    **Organized Profile Layout**
    I structured the profile into sections like About Me, Skills, What I’m Working On, and Connect with Me. This makes the profile easier to read and more professional.

    **Highlighted Skills Clearly**
    I listed my key technical skills in an organized manner.This helps recruiters quickly see my strengths and expertise.
