    - Example:
        ```bash
        gh issue list --repo srdangat/gh-cli-task-day26
        gh issue comment 1 --repo srdangat/gh-cli-task-day26 --body "Checked automatically."
        gh issue close 1 --repo srdangat/gh-cli-task-day26
        ```

    ![image](images/task5.1.png)

3. Answer in your notes: How could `gh run` and `gh workflow` be useful in a CI/CD pipeline?
